# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the [IMDB Sentiment Analysis Using XGBoost in SageMaker](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis/IMDB%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Using%20XGBoost%20in%20SageMaker.ipynb) notebook should provide enough background.

Please see the [Sentiment Analysis Tutorial Notebooks](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/Sentiment%20Analysis) README for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the Tutorial Notebooks).
